This project is for course enrollment for students.
For this we create all the requirements in step by step:
step 1: We create objects by using custom object or schema builders.
step 2: Next we create fields related to every object that we have created.
step 3: Next we do requirements that no field will be empty in every object means, every field should me filled with some data by the student. For this we written validaion rules for every object which also applied to the respective fields present in those objects.
step 4: After this we created workflow rule for to automate process. In this we are giving some criteria, if they met it automatically updates related fields.
step 5: If the course priority is high then it automatically changed to 'high priority' + course name this is one criteria. And the next one is if the course lead amount greater than USD $1000 then the customer name changed to 'top priority' + customer name.
step 6: Lastly we create a case for the student which helps student to connect with us if they need any suggestion or query related issues. For this we have given some fields like Name, phone, email, course enrolled, subject, instructor name, query description.
